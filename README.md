**Funding development:**
<br>
I am Paul, a solo-developer, which means I work on this project all by myself from design to coding to maintaing the project. I have been using a 7+ year old broken linux laptop, which has been a problem for me since I started this project. 
I am trying to get a new laptop so, I can work without much issues. 
<br/>
<br/>
so, if you'd like to support the development, you can [purchase a license](https://about.pyuibuilder.com/#pricing) with a one time payment, for a limited time, which will give you instant access to all the premium features
for life.  Thank you for your support! appreciate it very much
<br/>

**Output code generated for tkinter**
```py
# This code is generated by PyUIbuilder: https://github.com/PaulleDemon/PyUIBuilder

import tkinter as tk
from tktimepicker import AnalogPicker, AnalogThemes, constants
import tkintermapview

main = tk.Tk()
main.config(bg="#332f2f")
main.title("Main Window")

timepicker = AnalogPicker(parent=main, type=constants.HOURS12)
timepicker_theme = AnalogThemes(timepicker)
timepicker_theme.setNavyBlue()
timepicker.place(x=80, y=145, width=250, height=350)

map_viewer = tkintermapview.TkinterMapView(master=main)
map_viewer.place(x=423, y=181, width=400, height=250)

label = tk.Label(master=main, text="Sample text")
label.config(bg="#E4E2E2", fg="#000")
label.place(x=83, y=69, width=130, height=46)

button = tk.Button(master=main, text="Click me")
button.config(bg="#65ff4a", fg="#0b0909")
button.place(x=457, y=108, width=80, height=40)


main.mainloop() 
```

## FAQ


1. **Why do I need a GUI builder?**
    
    **A.** GUI builders assist you quickly create GUI without learning too much about GUI frameworks. It can also help you quickly prototype and see things visually. 

2. **Do I need to purchase a license to use this?**

   **A.** Webbased editor will remain free to use. To support open-source development, If you want a downloadable exe for local development and additional features, you'll need to purchase license based on your needs (hobbiest / commercial)

3. **How does this compare to other UI builders?**

   **A.** 
   * Most GUI builders out there are framework specific, this UI Builder tool is framework independent.

   * This outputs code in Python, not in XML or other formats which can be hard to debug. So its easier to modify even after downloading the code.

   * Support for 3rd party UI libraries. Many GUI builders don't come with support for 3rd party libraries. 

4. **Why doesn't the theme of the GUI builder match the theme of Tkinter?**
   
   **A.** Tkinter is a OS-dependent library, so it would render differently on different OS. Having a common UI the the GUI builder makes it simpler for development. 
   
   If you want a live preview before generating the code you can get a premium license and you'll be notified when that feature releases.
